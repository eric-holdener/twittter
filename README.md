# README

This is a twitter clone app built by following along to Web-Crunches video series "Let's Build: A Twitter Clone With Ruby on Rails"

This project was built as a warmup for TheOdinProject.com, to preface an individual project in which I will be building an application where members can write posts, but you can only see who wrote the post if you are logged in. Otherwise, each post is anonymous.
